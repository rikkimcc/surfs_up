#### Highlights:

- The average temperate in June is 74 and December is 71 degrees (F) - this shows Oahu has very little flucuation between these months

- The minimun temperature varies the most between the two months (64 in June and 56 in December). December is reflecting a much lower minimun temperature which may defer guests from enjoying ice cream and surfing.

- The maximum temperatures are shockingly very similar and only 2 degrees apart (85 F June and 83 F December)
